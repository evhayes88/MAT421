They can only represent positive integers. As a result, a standard was created in order to represent fractional numbers in a computer. The standard is IEEE754. A fractional number will be represented by the following parts:\n","\n","*   Sign Indicator\n","*   Exponent\n","*   Fraction\n","\n","Depending on the precision of the number, a certain amount of bits will be allocated to each of the listed parts.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Ywr0lJPj0gNR"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 9.3 Round-off Errors\n","\n","### Representation Error\n","\n","Representation error is due to the fact that a computer has a finite amount of bits and numbers such as $\\pi$ or $1/3$ would require an infinite amount. As such, there will be an error between the floating point representation and it's theoritical value. \n","\n","### Error by Floating-Point Arithmetic\n","\n","Numbers are often approximated as a floating point number and will then contain a very small error. When arithmetic is applied these errors can cause issues in a program.
